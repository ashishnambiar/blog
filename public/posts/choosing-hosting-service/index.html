<p>I finally decided to use Digital Ocean&rsquo;s &ldquo;App Platform&rdquo; to host this blog site.
So this is currently available on both github pages and DO.</p>
<p>This is just a small update to keep you in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4E8SsodyGGLgv7HPeSisw5?si=1a093a5fb6a445d7">The
Loop</a>.
Anyways, I feel like I got this out of my chest so now I can start writing some
more meaningful blogs that might be more relevant to coding and stuff. I am
going to be posting here kind of semi-randomly, without sticking to any
specific topic, but it will most probably about coding. I will try to put a
blog either weekly or bi-weekly.</p>
<h2 id="the-digital-ocean-setup">The Digital Ocean Setup</h2>
<p>It was actually quite easy. Since I already had the whole thing already setup,
all I had to do was host it using DO. But there was a small issue.</p>
<p>For some reason, when creating a new thing with &ldquo;App Platform&rdquo;, I got the Error
<code>No Components Detected</code>. This was because DO didn&rsquo;t detect the hugo project
like it says in the
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-and-deploy-a-hugo-site-to-digitalocean-app-platform#step-4-deploying-to-digitalocean-with-app-platform">tutorial</a>.
<code>DO</code> needs an <code>index.html</code> to detect that the project is a static site.
Thankfully, you can just remove the <code>public</code> directory from the <code>.gitignore</code>,
so that you can set the &ldquo;Source Directory&rdquo; from DO. It was slightly silly, but
it wasn&rsquo;t a big issue.</p>
<p>I know that this is not Linode, and not Object Store, that <a href="/posts/hugo-blog-setup">I
wanted</a> . I initially considered using Digital Ocean&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Spaces Object Store&rdquo;, but I thought, it is better to have something than to
mess with something I have never done before. I might try it later if a
necessity comes, I may directly shift to Linode once that is available to me.</p>
<h2 id="next-step">Next Step</h2>
<p>I want to get a domain; possibly for free, so that I can have something to
simply give to people without
<a href="https://blog-evibj.ondigitalocean.app/"><code>ondigitalocean</code></a> in the domain. Looks
kind of unprofessional.</p>
