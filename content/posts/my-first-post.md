### What is this?
This is a *blog* I created for journaling things, happenings,
knowledge, etc. Basically this will be repository of things.

### Who am I?
I am Ashish Nambiar. I am a Mobile App Developer by profession. I specialize in
[*Flutter*](https://flutter.dev), But also familiar with a little bit of backend
in [*GO*](go.dev) and *JS*.

### What next?
I want to learn a couple of things like:
- game development
    - App based games
    - Love2D
    - TUI games
    - A universal game(A concept I thought of, which probably already exists
      but don't know the name of)
- backend
    - authentication
    - hosting
    - databases
- automation
    - python
    - build systems
- website devlopment
    - some CSS
    - canvas
    - create custom theme for hugo(and replace this one)
- devops
- writing a small book using groff
- coding challenges
    - advent of code
    - data structures
- Flutter
    - TDD
    - working with RenderObjects and custom widgets
    - `CustomPaint` => [an interesting reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD38Yyz7N2E)

I know these are too many topics for a single person to learn in a life time,
but I want to try each of these at least once and familiarize with the things
that can help me with my development skills in future. The problem is the
indecisive monkey in my brain is incapable of deciding what to do. Even this
website took a lot of convincing from ...myself to start.

There are also few projects I am working on. I need to set a priority list to
stick with a project until it is done. These are not very big projects, just
some things that interest me. 

This is just a start. I will try to keep this as updated as possible, at least
once a weak.
