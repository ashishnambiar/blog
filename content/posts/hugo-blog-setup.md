## Setting up this blog using [`HUGO`](https://gohugo.io/) 

Creating this blog was relatively easy, because there are not many dependencies
with hugo. The main problems I face these days is just `node`. I don't like
`node`. Anyways, there were not many steps involved in creating this blog. 

From my perspective the steps were:
1. Install [`hugo`](https://gohugo.io/installation/).
2. Go through the ["Getting
   Started"](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) guide.
3. Check the tutorial for hosting hugo sites on Linode Object Store.
4. Login to Linode to realize that my account has been blocked due to
   "Fraudulent Activity".
5. Be sad and send an email to Linode support.
6. Go through the ["Host on Github
   Pages"](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/)
   instead.
7. Rejoice after seeing my blog hosted on github pages

I have currently hosted this blog on github pages, which might be redundant to
say that because you were smart enough to see that from the URL bar. It this is
not hosted on github pages, I problably hosted this on some other service.

## Why didn't I just use a different Object Store for the blog? 

Actually, because my brain didn't let me. 

I was kind of hoping to get it hosted on Linode and only looked over the
options:
- GCloud
- AWS S3
- Firebase
- Vercel 

For some reason I didn't like any of these. I couldn't explain the reason. It
might have been also because some guy on reddit posted his bill for $100,000.

I also *liked* Linode for their affliation with Linux-focused content creators,
mainly [Learn Linux TV](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnLinuxTV/videos). It might
also be because I (used to) daily drive Linux Mint. But, whatever the reason
was I had fixed my mind on Linode and was hoping everything would be fine.

## What did I mean by "blocked due to fraudulent activity"?

Ok, this was kind of stupid. 

Tldr; I used a Rupay credit card first, then used a blocked credit card
...multiple times. I thought it wouldn't matter. As soon as I found the email
in my inbox, I realized it **did** matter. This was about a year ago.

I totally forgot about everything that had happend, which eventually made me
sad. So sad that I forgot to say my daily affirmations before bedtime, now I
have a headache. I have raised a ticket with Linode support to restore my
account. Hopefully, I will get back my Linode account in this lifetimeðŸ¤ž.

I will be shifting this blog and hosting a few other sites on Linode as soon as
I get my account back. Till then, I am going to host this stuff on github pages
until I find an alternative that is not going to bill me to bankruptcy.

I am going to host this stuff on github pages until I get back my Linode
account, or find an alternative that is not going to bill me to bankruptcy. I
am probably not going to find an alternative, becuase I am too lazy.
